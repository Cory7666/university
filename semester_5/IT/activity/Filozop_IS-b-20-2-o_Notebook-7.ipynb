    "The `return_sorted()` and `sort_and_return()` functions do about the same job: they take a list as input, sort it, and return it. At the moment when the function is entered (Step 5), the situation in both fragments is identical: there is a variable outside the function `this_list`, inside the function there is a variable `my_list`, they both point to the same list. The key difference happens in the next step. The `return_sorted()` function uses the `sorted()` function to create a new list. Then it assigns (`=`) the result of the `sorted()` execution the my_list variable . This leads to the fact that a variable with this name begins to refer to a new object (Step 7), and the old one (which is still referenced by this_list) remains intact. `sort_and_return()` works quite differently — it uses the `sort()` method, which sorts the list in place, inside itself. In this case, a new object is not created, the assignment operation is not used and the variable `my_list` continues to refer to the same list as before. It just turns out to be sorted."
